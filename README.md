## Project goals

Goals of the project are to learn how to use open APIs and merge the retrieved data into new information. One goal is to make API that could be useful for someone.

## Methods, technologies, tools

Due to late information about the project work and tight schedule (!), the project group just tries to implement the application as fast as possible without using any methods like scrum, etc.

Application will be made with Node.js as back-end technology and Express.js as web-application framework.

The example application, that uses the implemented API, will be made by using HTML5, CSS3 and possibly AngularJS if needed.

Jetbrains Webstorm is the IDE that will be used for web development.

## Used APIs

We will use following APIs:
* **Amica API (http://apisuomi.fi/shop/json/amica-ruokalistat-api/)**
* **Juvenes API**
* **Sodexo API**


## Project schedule

* **14.11. Project plan to Github and issue about project plan**
* **04.12. Return the assignment / project ready**
* **05.-09.12. Assignment presentation for assistant**

## Testing

The API will be tested by QA leader of the group (Daniel Kullberg)
